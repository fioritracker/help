# Learn more about Fiori Tracker

## Fiori Tracker Suite

Fiori Tracker is a suite of SAP Fiori-native apps ([see the complete list](comp-main.md)) for keeping a record of your SAP Fiori launchpad's implementation or maintenance scope. The scope is the list of the applications and catalogs you plan to implement or support (referred to as ["To-be" records](to-be.md)). Application's and catalog's ["To-be" records](to-be.md) serve as a reference for comparison with actual system configuration (called ["As-is"](as-is.md)). "As-is" relations enable the project team to control setting up the SAP Fiori launchpad, crucial in projects with many applications deployed across multiple systems.
