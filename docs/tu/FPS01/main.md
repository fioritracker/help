# Test users

The Test users app lets you create, change, and list test user records. Test user records are linked directly with roles and indirectly with catalogs and apps.

Section with content type [Test users and their passwords](../../tracked/SPS03/testusers.md) gives a detailed overview.

You can use the app to keep [Centralized test users lists with passwords](../../usecases/SPS03/test-users.md)
