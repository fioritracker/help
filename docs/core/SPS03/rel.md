# Fiori Tracker Relations

`Relations` represent the link form records for applications and catalogs to any other objects that you would like to track.

## Standard relations 
There are two standard relations that come with FT Applications and FT Catalog apps:

FT Apps Relation: [To-be Catalogs](../../core/SPS03/apps-rel-tobe-cats.md) - for keeping "To-be" assignments of apps to catalogs

FT Catalogs Relation: [To-be Apps](../../core/SPS03/cats-rel-tobe-apps.md) - for keeping "To-be" assignments of catalogs to applications 

In addition to standard relations you can install optional ones. You choose the relations that are relevant to your project. Theres is also a possibility to build you own custom relations.
