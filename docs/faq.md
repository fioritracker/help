## 2. Does is send any data (statistics) to outside servers (what is the security model)?

No data is send to any outside servers. Fiori Tracker does not need external access and is run by many users on installations that do not have external access.  All code is in ABAP meaning it is fully transparent and available for inspection.

## 3. Is the Premier support mandatory after certain time period?

No. Premier support is optional and you can continue using Fiori Tracker as it is, free of charge as long as you want.

## 4. What are the prerequisites/minimal requirements for installation?

Minimal requirement is any SAP system with GAP Gateway (software component SAP_GWFND) on SAP NetWeaver version at least 7.52 ([see details](inst/min.md))

Yes. Fiori Tracker release numbering is independent from SAP release numbering. Fiori Tracker release 2020 is compatible with SAP S/4 HANA releases from 1610 to 2020. Refer [Minimal requirements](inst/min.md) for more details.

## 6. What details do you need for troubleshooting the issues?

## 7. What are the features that are available for free version (1909 SPS06) and licensed version (2020 FPS01)?

In terms of features, both versions are almost the sameâ€”the main difference is in architecture.
