# Installation - General considerations


## Overview

To install Fiori Tracker please follow the installations guides that are in the **Installation** section of each component page. 

We designed each Fiori Tracker Suite product to work independently. Once you install the product and any dependent products are needed, it will guide the user to install those.

## Deployment options

We have designed Fiori Tracker components to enable flexible installation options. Depending on your SAP landscape setup and your organization constraints, you can deploy Fiori Tracker in the way that suits your project the best. [See details](inst/dep.md).

## Minimal requirements

Minimal requirement is any SAP system with GAP Gateway (software component SAP_GWFND) on SAP NetWeaver version at least 7.52 ([see details](inst/min.md))

## [Components compatibility](inst/comp.md)
