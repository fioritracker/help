# Evaluating upgrade impact

Whenever you perform a system or a component upgrade, you might want to review all your applications. With the list of all Fiori launchpad enabled applications held in Fiori Tracker, you get the list that you can use a backlog for compatibility checks. ["Sign-offs"](../../../so/FPS01/main/) records allow checking progress tracking and reporting.
