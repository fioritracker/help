# Evaluating upgrade impact

Whenever you perform a system or a component upgrade, you might want to review all your SAP Fiori applications. The list of all SAP Fiori launchpad-enable applications kept in Fiori Tracker serves as a backlog for the compatibility checks. I addition, ["Sign-offs"](../../../so/FPS01/main/) records allow checking progress tracking and reporting.
