Projects often track the change requests. They keep records of the changes in Jira or Solution Manager, but the link to an exact SAP Fiori application is unavailable. This makes tracking the changes time-consuming or impossible. 

With Fiori Tracker central reference of all applications in scope, you can quickly find out what was the history of the changes of a specific app. This allows you quickly find out what could be a possible reason for an issue or who could help resolving it.
