# Fiori Launchpad Content requirements gathering

Collecting requirements in the preparation phase of SAP implementation requires teamwork. Both technical and functional experts are involved. For large projects with multiple streams, the team needs a central directory of agreed Fiori Launchpad content. Usually, the team uses a shared spreadsheet.

 Rather than storing your scope definition in spreadsheets, Fiori Tracker manages it. The application enables data quality control, as it limits possible entries only to the correct ones. The application also checks certain fields to prevent duplication. The check is crucial, for example, for catalogs and Fiori app identifiers. This duplication check is not available with spreadsheets.
## The challenges
