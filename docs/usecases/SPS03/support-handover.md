# Handover to support

When the system goes live your support team will start receiving questions from end-users. It is important, that they know how SAP Fiori launchpad was set up, otherwise the business will suffer. For small teams, handover can be easy to manage. In larger implementations, your support team might be part of a separate organization. Sometimes the external consulting company that will operate the support, competes with the one that carried out the implementation. If this is the case, a support handover document could be useful. A support handover documentation heal in Fiori Tracker captures all of this information in one place.
