# Scope control

The main part of the "To-be" documentation is the list of Fiori launchpad enabled applications that determine the projectâ€™s scope. Adding a new app to the Fiori launchpad, especially a custom one, has a major cost impact thus should be tracked. By keeping the rule of including the app entry in the documentation before implementing it, you will gain scope control, together with documentation accuracy. 

Fiori Tracker Suite component called [Fiori Apps Usage](../../../fa/FPS01/main/) lets you check what apps are launched by users and whether they are part of the scope already.
