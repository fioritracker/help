# Adding an application to a user

To make the application available to the user, you must first add it to the Business catalog. Then you have to assign the catalog to the role. Finally, the user must be assigned a role. 

## Challenge

The main challenge is that applications are not added directly to users. The request that might look like a quick update, might need additional decisions. Depending on the state of your current configuration adding app will require different steps.
