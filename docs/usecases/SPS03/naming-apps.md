# Naming conventions

Here are two naming conventions for custom apps that user can consider:

### 1. Using the name of the BSP 

Using the name of the BSP object used to store UI5 project in ABAP repository. For example "ZFTCA". 

For other type of Fiori launchpad enabled apps one can use the prefix for the app type and the unique ID that is used within this type of the app. For example, for a Multidimensional reports application can be prefixed with "ZMD".

All custom BSP use naming convention that separates them from SAP standard ones (f.e. Z*). This way your custom applications will not be mixed up with SAP's standard ones.

### 2. Using the number assigned to a change request 

This number (often assigned to so called WRICEF) is used to identify the change request for requirement to create the application.

Prefix the number with "Z" to separate them from SAP standard ones.
