# "As-is" records

The "As-is" records reflect the current system value of the object. They are system-dependent and collected with the use of As-is API component. As-is API synchronizes the values from all your managed systems to view them at once from the central system.
 
In addition to "As-is" records Fiori Tracker suite leverages two more types of records: 

1. ["To-be"](to-be.md)
2. ["Info records"](info-records.md)
