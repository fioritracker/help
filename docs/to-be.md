# "To-be" records

Fiori Tracker suite leverages two types of records: 

1. "To-be"
2. "As-is." 

The "To-be" records reflect the state of the content that your project plans to implement.
 
Working with "To-be" records is particularly valuable during:

1. Functional and technical teams' joint efforts to define the content in the preparation phase. They serve as a blueprint during the implementation phase. Rather than storing your scope definition in spreadsheets, Fiori Tracker manages it. The application enables data quality control, as it limits possible entries only to the correct ones. The application also checks certain fields to prevent duplication. The check is crucial, for example, for catalogs and Fiori app identifiers. This duplication check is not available with spreadsheets.

2. While the support team resolves issues with systems. The team can use them to verify the expected system configuration.
