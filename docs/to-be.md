# "To-be" records

Fiori Tracker suite apps leverage two types of records: "To-be" and "As-is." The "To-be" records reflect the state of the content that your project sign-offed to implement in the system. "To-be" records serve as a blueprint and reference for the current system set up during the implementation or support phase.

Working with "To-be" records is particularly valuable during:
1. Functional and technical teams' joint efforts to define the content in the preparation phase.
2. While the support team resolves issues to refer what is the supposed system setting.
