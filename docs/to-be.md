# "To-be" records

The "To-be" records reflect the state of the content that your project plans to implement.
 
Working with "To-be" records is particularly valuable during:

1. Functional and technical teams' joint efforts to define the content in the preparation phase. They serve as a blueprint during the implementation phase.

2. While the support team resolves issues with systems. The team can use them to verify the expected system configuration.

In addition to "To-be" Fiori Tracker suite leverages two more types of records: 

1. ["As-is"](as-is.md)
2. ["Info records"](info-records.md)
