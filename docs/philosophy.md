# Philosophy

Before deciding to use Fiori Tracker suite, it's a good idea to understand the philosophy behind the project. That way, you can make sure it fits with what you're trying to achieve.

## Design principles

- **Build to free S/4HANA team from routine work** - On our fist S/4HANA implementation we noticed many routine tasks that SAP Developers and other team members kept doing in addition of their main work. One example is explaining how to identify the Fiori applications and what is needed to enable them for end users. 

- **Made to blueprint** - Besides the system setup, maintaining records of the intended system configuration streamlines S/4HANA deployment and support. This clear distinction between planning and execution minimizes delays.
