# Philosophy

Before deciding to use Fiori Tracker suite, it's a good idea to understand the philosophy behind the project. That way, you can make sure it fits with what you're trying to achieve.

## Design principles

- **Build to free the team from routine work** - On our fist S/4HANA implementation we noticed many routine tasks that SAP Developers and other SAP S/4HANA team members kept doing in addition of their main work. One example is explaining how to identify the Fiori applications and what is needed to enable them for end users. We build Fiori Tracker to get rid of those mundane tasks and focus on our main goals.

- **Made to blueprint** - Besides the system setup, maintaining records of the intended system configuration streamlines S/4HANA deployment and support. This clear distinction between planning and execution minimizes delays.

- **Accessible for all team members** - Available in your SAP landscape, for example in QA system with the same SAP users your team already has. 

- **Connected with actual system setup** 

- **Open for further development** - To capitalize on existing pool of content types. Over time we have rebuild the Fiori Tracker suite several times to make it open for adding handing additional content types and relations. Fiori Tracker Suite is also open to customer-specific extensions that will not be placed in official releases.
